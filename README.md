# Stanford193p-Memorize
This is a memorization-based card game developed using SwiftUI from the Stanford CS193p Spring 2020 course (https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/) where players must match cards of the same image.
Some of the features of this game include having cards flip face up when touching them and having an animated timer to notify the player how much time they have left.
I also added multiple themes to the game as well as a point system.
